# DEVELOPER NOTES
#
# CLOUD RESOURCE STRUCTURE
# Each cloud resource has a structure named '{cloud}{resource-type}Resource';
# for example, GcpGcsBucketResource. It has two properties: 'metadata' and 'attributes'
#
# The 'metadata' property is a reference to the common metadata structure for all resource types:
#  $ref: '#/components/schemas/ResourceMetadata'
# Metadata includes both the common data for all resources and an optional structure for
# properties of controlled resources.
#
# The 'attributes' property is a reference to a unique structure named '{cloud}{resource-type}Attributes';
# for example, GcpGcsBucketAttributes. Attributes are specific to the cloud resource so may
# be a complex structure.
#
# The resource structure should be used as the common form of return in the CRUD operations on
# the object. Well, the CRU ones anyway...
#
# ENUMERATION STRUCTURE
# Resource enumeration returns ResourceList - a list of ResourceDescription. Each description
# provides the common metadata, as described above and then a union structure with an entry
# for the metadata for each cloud resource type. It is a bit clumsy, but provides complete
# description for a resource.
