        Permissions associated with the SAS indicating what operations a client may perform on the resource. Must be a 
        string consisting of some combination following available permissions:

        | Permission | Description |
        |------------|-------------|
        |`r`         | Read        |
        |`a`         | Add         |
        |`c`         | Create      |
        |`w`         | Write       |
        |`d`         | Delete      |
        |`l`         | List        |


        For example:
          * To construct a SAS with permissions limited to read, write and list the caller would supply the string
        `rwl`.
          * To construct a SAS with permissions limited to add, create, write and delete, the caller would supply the 
        string `acwd`.

        If the calling user does not have the requisite role against the workspace for the requested permissions, this
        operation will return a 403 Forbidden error.
