        How to clone resource:
          * COPY_NOTHING: Don't clone resource.
          * COPY_DEFINITION: Only used for controlled resources. Create new controlled resource
            and new cloud resource with same metadata, but don't copy any data. For example
            for GCS bucket, create new GCS bucket with same region/lifecycle rules as source
            bucket. Files will not be copied over.
          * COPY_RESOURCE: Only used for controlled resources. Create new controlled resource
            and new cloud resource, with data copied over.  For example for GCS bucket,
            create new GCS bucket with same region/lifecycle rules as source bucket. Copy files
            from source bucket to new bucket.
          * COPY_REFERENCE: Only used for referenced resources. Create new referenced resource
            that points to same cloud resource as source referenced resource.
