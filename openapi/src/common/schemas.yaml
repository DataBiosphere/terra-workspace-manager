        How to clone resource:
          * COPY_NOTHING: Don't clone resource.
          * COPY_DEFINITION: Only used for controlled resources. Create new controlled resource
            and new cloud resource with same metadata, but don't copy any data. For example
            for GCS bucket, create new GCS bucket with same region/lifecycle rules as source
            bucket. Files will not be copied over.
          * COPY_RESOURCE: Only used for controlled resources. Create new controlled resource
            and new cloud resource, with data copied over.  For example for GCS bucket,
            create new GCS bucket with same region/lifecycle rules as source bucket. Copy files
            from source bucket to new bucket.
          * COPY_REFERENCE: Used for controlled and referenced resources. Create new referenced resource
            that points to same cloud resource as source resource.
          * COPY_LINK_REFERENCE: Used for controlled and referenced resources. Create a new referenced resource
            that points to the same cloud resource as the source resource, AND link the source workspace
            policy to the destination workspace policy; changes in the source will propagate to the destination.
