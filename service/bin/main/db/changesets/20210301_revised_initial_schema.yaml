    - createTable:
        tableName: workspace
        remarks: |
          There is one row in the workspace table for each workspace.
        columns:
          - column:
              name: workspace_id
              type: text
              constraints:
                primaryKey: true
                nullable: false
          - column:
              name: display_name
              type: text
              remarks: |
                A user-friendly name for the workspace. There is no guarantee of uniqueness across workspaces.
                Can be null. Omitted for Rawls workspaces, since Rawls maintains its own name
          - column:
              name: description
              type: text
              remarks: |
                Free-form text describing the workspace. Can be null. Omitted for Rawls workspaces, since Rawls
                maintains its own description.
          - column:
              name: spend_profile
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: true
                unique: false
          - column:
              name: properties
              type: jsonb
              remarks: |
                Key-value map to allow applications to store their data about the workspace
          - column:
              name: workspace_stage
              type: text
              remarks: |
                The workspace_stage column is used to hide/expose different features of
                WSM for different clients. The valid values as of this writing are
                RAWLS_WORKSPACE and MC_WORKSPACE

    - createTable:
        tableName: cloud_context
        columns:
          - column:
              name: workspace_id
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
                references: workspace(workspace_id)
                foreignKeyName: fk_cloud_context_wid
                deleteCascade: true
              remarks: |
                Foreign key will cause cloud_context to be deleted when its associated
                workspace is deleted.
          - column:
              name: cloud_platform
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
              remarks: |
                Enum of the cloud: GCP and AZURE are the current types
          - column:
              name: context
              type: jsonb
              remarks: |
                JSON form of the information for the specific cloud context
                
    - addPrimaryKey:
        columnNames: workspace_id, cloud_platform
        tableName: cloud_context
        constraintName: pk_cloud_context
        remarks: |
          Define the PK separately so that we control the order of the columns

    - createTable:
        tableName: application
        remarks: |
          The application table lists all integrated applications configured in the
          current Terra deployment.
        columns:
          - column:
              name: application_id
              type: text
              constraints:
                primaryKey: true
                nullable: false
          - column:
              name: display_name
              type: text
              remarks: |
                A user-friendly name for the application. Not used by WSM. Not necessarily unique. Optional.
          - column:
              name: description
              type: text
              remarks: |
                Free-form description of the application. Optional.

              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
                unique: true
              remarks: |
                Each application must have a unique service account. That SA is used to
                grant the application access to a specific workspace.

    - createTable:
        tableName: enabled_application
        remarks: |
          Workspaces may enable a subset of the available applications. This table maps
          a workspace to an application it has enabled.
        columns:
          - column:
              name: workspace_id
              type: text
              constraints:
                references: workspace(workspace_id)
                foreignKeyName: fk_enabled_application_workspace_id
                nullable: false
                deleteCascade: true
              remarks: |
                Deletion of a workspace will cascade to delete the mapping to the
                workspace's enabled applications.
          - column:
              name: application_id
              type: text
              constraints:
                references: application(application_id)
                foreignKeyName: fk_enabled_application_application_id
                nullable: false

    - createTable:
        tableName: resource
        remarks: |
          Each WSM resource has an entry in this table, regardless of what kind of
          resource it is
        columns:
          - column:
              name: workspace_id
              type: text
              constraints:
                references: workspace(workspace_id)
                foreignKeyName: fk_resource_workspace_id
                nullable: false
                deleteCascade: true
              remarks: |
                First part of the foreign key to cloud_context. Foreign key will cause
                resource to be deleted when its associated cloud_context is deleted.
          - column:
              name: cloud_platform
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
              remarks: |
                Enum of the cloud: GCP and AZURE are the current types
                Second part of the foreign key to cloud_context
          - column:
              name: resource_id
              type: text
              constraints:

              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
          - column:
              name: description
              type: text
          - column:
              name: stewardship_type
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
              remarks: |
                Enumeration of how the WSM stewards the resource. Current types are
                REFERENCE - the resource is a reference to a cloud object not managed by WSM
                CONTROLLED - the resource is controlled by WSM for lifecycle, IAM, and policy
          - column:
              name: resource_type
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
              remarks: |
                Enumeration of the resource type. Resource types are specific to the cloud
                and resource; e.g., GCS_BUCKET, BIG_QUERY_DATASET
          - column:
              name: cloning_instructions
              type: text
              constraints:
                nullable: false
              remarks: |
                Enumeration of the cloning instructions. Details TBD
          - column:
              name: attributes
              type: jsonb
              constraints:
                nullable: true
              remarks: |
                Attributes are used by both referenced resources and controlled
                resources to store resource-specific metadata. This bit of overloading
                between referenced and controlled resource data allows us to avoid a
                separate referenced_resource table that would have a single column for its
                metadata.
          - column:
              name: access_scope
              type: text
              remarks: |
                Must be valid, non-null for controlled resources. Must be null for reference resources.
                Enum of the possible access scopes of the controlled resource. Values are
                ACCESS_SHARED, ACCESS_PRIVATE
          - column:
              name: managed_by
              type: text
              remarks: |
                Must be valid, non-null for controlled resources. Must be null for reference resources.
                Enum of the possible managers of the controlled resource. Values are
                USER, APPLICATION
          - column:
              name: associated_app
              type: text
              constraints:
                references: application(application_id)
                foreignKeyName: fk_associated_app
              remarks: |
                Only valid for controlled resources. Must be null for reference resources.
                The associated app will be null for USER_SHARED and USER_PRIVATE
                access. It must be filled in for APP_SHARED and APP_PRIVATE access.
          - column:
              name: assigned_user
              type: text
              remarks: |
                Only valid for controlled resources. Must be null for reference resources.
                The assigned_user will be null for USER_SHARED and APP_SHARED access.
                It MAY be filled in, if a user is currently assigned, for USER_PRIVATE
                and APP_PRIVATE access.

    - addUniqueConstraint:
        constraintName: unique_resource_name
        tableName: resource
        columnNames: workspace_id, name
        deferrable: true
        remarks: |
          Resource names must be unique within a workspace
