  Copied from the https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators tagged release 1.0.24:
  https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen-generators/blob/v1.0.24/src/main/resources/handlebars/Java/generatedAnnotation.mustache

  This file is not important to Terra's codegen customizations, but needs to be included in order
  to get Swagger Codegen to successfully compile. If this file is not included, a Handlebars
  exception is thrown ("The partial [path-to-generatedAnnotation.mustache] could not be found").

  In theory, it should be possible to override individual Swagger template files without copying
  all dependent templates locally (https://github.com/swagger-api/swagger-codegen/issues/10272),
  but in practice it's necessary to include all files that the main template depends on.
