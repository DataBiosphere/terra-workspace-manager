# Hotfix Process

See the [HOTFIX.md](https://github.com/broadinstitute/terra-helmfile/blob/master/docs/HOTFIX.md) documentation in [terra-helmfile](https://github.com/broadinstitute/terra-helmfile) for the general MC-Terra hotfix procedure, which applies to Workspace Manager

Should the hotfix process deviate from the general procedure outlined in terra-helmfile, this document should be updated to highlight those differences.
