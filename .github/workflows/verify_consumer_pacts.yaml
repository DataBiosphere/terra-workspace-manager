name: Verify consumer pacts
# The purpose of this workflow is to verify ANY consumer contract(s) dependent on workspacemanager provider using Pact
# framework.
#
# The workflow meets the criteria of Pact Broker *Platinum* as described in https://docs.pact.io/pact_nirvana/step_6.
# The can-i-deploy job has been added to this workflow to gate the merge of PRs into develop branch.
#
# This workflow is triggered when
#
# 1. Consumer makes a change that results in a new pact published to Pact Broker (will verify ONLY the changed pact and publish the verification results back to the broker)
# 2. Provider makes a change (runs verification tests against ALL DEPLOYED consumer pact versions and publishes corresponding verification results)
#
#
# The workflow requires the following Pact Broker credentials:
# - PACT_BROKER_USERNAME - the Pact Broker username
# - PACT_BROKER_PASSWORD - the Pact Broker password
on:
  # pull_request:
  #   branches: [ main ]
  #   paths-ignore: [ '**.md' ]
  # push:
  #   branches: [ main ]
  #   paths-ignore: [ '**.md' ]
  # merge_group:
  #   branches: [ main ]
  #   paths-ignore: [ '**.md' ]
