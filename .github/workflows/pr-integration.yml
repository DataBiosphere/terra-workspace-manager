# Action for running client integration tests against PRs. This test uses local
# server changes but runs a published version of the client, so it will not pick

    # There is an issue with GitHub required checks and paths-ignore. We don't really need to
    # run the tests if there are only irrelevant changes (see paths-ignore above). However,
    # we require tests to pass by making a "required check" rule on the branch. If the action
    # is not triggered, the required check never passes and you are stuck. Therefore, we have
    # to run tests even when we only change a markdown file. So don't do what I did and put a
    # paths-ignore right here!
