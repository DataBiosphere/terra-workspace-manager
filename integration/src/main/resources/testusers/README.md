# WSM Integration Test Users

Workspace Manager currently uses 3 test users for running integration tests with varying levels of access to external resources: 
- `bella.redwalker@test.firecloud.org`
- `elijah.thunderlord@test.firecloud.org`
- `liam.dragonmaw@test.firecloud.org`

Tests generate credentials for these users via domain-wide delegation. More information about test user configuration (including information for setting up additional test users) is available [on Confluence](https://broadinstitute.atlassian.net/wiki/spaces/GAWB/pages/115259774/The+Testerson+Family+and+the+Order+of+the+QA). See the linked "Test Horde" sheet when setting up additional test users.

Workspace Manager integration tests also talk to a number of external resources.
These include:
- Read access to TDR snapshots specified per-environment by UUID values in test configs
    - Owned by Jade team in all environments. Test user `Albus Dumbledore` can also grant other test users access.
- Usage of the `wm-default-spend-profile` spend profile in Sam
    - Owned by `developer-admins` and Platform Foundations team
    - Read access to the `terra_wsm_test_dataset` BigQuery dataset, `terra wsm test data table` BigQuery data table, and `terra_wsm_test_resource` 
      GCS bucket with uniform access, `terra_wsm_fine_grained_test_bucket` GCS bucket with fine-grained access, both in the `terra-kernel-k8s` GCP project.
        - Owned by Platform Foundation and App Services teams.
  
Users have different access to the above resources. Some tests also rely on specific
users not having resource access, e.g. testing that a user cannot use a spend profile
without having access. Changing user access on these external resources may break
existing tests. If you need a user with a combination of resource accesses that
doesn't currently exist, consider minting a new test user.

Currently, users have the following access permissions, replicated across environments:

|                                           | TDR Snapshot       | `wm-default-spend-profile` | BQ Dataset `terra_wsm_test_dataset` | BQ Data table `terra wsm test data table` | Bucket `terra_wsm_test_resource` | Bucket `terra_wsm_fine_grained_test_bucket` | Bucket object `terra_wsm_fine_grained_test_bucket/foo/` | Bucket object `terra_wsm_fine_grained_test_bucket/foo/monkey_sees_monkey_dos.txt` |
